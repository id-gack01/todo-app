<!--the click action activates the resetForm function defined the employee component  -->

 <!-- <div class="input-field col s12">
                                <label>Completion Status: </label>
                                <input type="text" name="taskdescription" name="ngModel" [(ngModel)]="taskService.selectedTask.completionstatus" placeholder="choose a status">
                            </div> -->

the dropdownlist that requires money
<ejs-dropdownlist [dataSource]="CompletionStatus" placeholder = 'Choose a completion staus' 
                            [(ngModel)]="taskService.selectedTask.completionstatus" popupHeight='200px' popupWidth='250px'> 

                            </ejs-dropdownlist>

the form flatout isn't showing up still

so I had partial success in posting from the angular front end, however, only the generated id and completion status successfully posted
turns out you need the #name for a directive in angular 
I also need to make sure the name (different from the #name above) to match the model names in the task shared folder
