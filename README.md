# todo-app
created a program to enter and display tasks in a todo app setting

no styles because I don't need those

npm init to get node modules

npm i nodemon cors express rxjs 

get mongodb set up (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/),

make a collection labeled tasks

in a terminal, first do
node db.js

nodemon start in the folder where app.js is located to start the back end

to open the angular app
https://angular.io/guide/setup-local

npm install -g @angular/cli (to install angular globably)

type in a terminal (google how to install angular i guess)
ng serve --open 

this starts the front end
