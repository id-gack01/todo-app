# todo-app
created a program to enter and display tasks in a todo app setting

no styles because I don't need those

npm init to get node modules

npm i nodemon cors express rxjs 

get mongodb set up, make a collection labeled tasks


nodemon start in the folder where app.js is located to start the back end

to open the angular app

type in a terminal (google how to install angular i guess)
ng serve --open 

this starts the front end
